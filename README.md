### Clean Architecture

There are 3 layers in the project: Data, Domain and Presentation(UI), and the UI layer contains view and presenters (view model).
The modules are parallel and include only the Core module (containing only interfaces and application models).
Communication between modules is established through the App module (Dagger 2).

- Data layer is dispense the required data for the application to the domain layer by implementing interface exposed by the core.
- Domain layer is execute business logic which is independent of any layer.
- Presentation layer is include domain layer and is android specific which executes the UI logic.
